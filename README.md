# MERN Stacker

**MERN Stacker** is a CLI tool that scaffolds a modern MERN-style project with a **React + Vite frontend** and an **Express backend**.

It guides you through a small set of interactive prompts to choose your language, routing, frontend features, database setup, Docker presets, and package manager—so you can start building immediately without copy-pasting boilerplate.

## Why MERN Stacker

Creating full-stack starters repeatedly is slow and error-prone. MERN Stacker solves this by:

- Generating a clean, minimal base project
- Composing features instead of duplicating templates
- Letting you opt into only what you need (Tailwind, TanStack Query, Zustand, databases, Docker, etc.)
- Keeping the generated code understandable and easy to modify

The goal is **a solid foundation, not a locked-in framework**.

## Usage

Run the CLI using `npx`:

```bash
npx mern-stacker my-app
```
